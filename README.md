# Anti-Grabify 
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Anti-Grabify browser extension! If you're here, you are probably concerned about protecting your online privacy from users using services like Grabify or IPLogger. With Anti-Grabify, you'll be protected from links from those two services, as well as many other smaller ones! Alongside the browser extension, this repository is home to the Anti-Grabify uBlock Origin blocklist, which blocks the same URLs as the extension.

# Features
* **Effective Protection:** Anti-Grabify works by stopping the link from even loading when you click on it, thus saving your IP address from being grabbed.
* **Easy to Use:** All you have to do is install the extension, and you're good to go! Links will be blocked automatically as it runs in the background. You may also disable the extension on your browser's extension/addon page.
* **Frequent Updates:** Anti-Grabify receives updates throughout the year to remove dead URLs and add live URLs, ensuring you are protected from even the newest of IP grabber links.
